# bug-report-to-test-generation
Hybrid NLP and Large Language Model–based pipeline for bug-report–driven automated test input extraction and integration with EvoSuite and Pynguin.
# Bug-Report–Driven Test Generation Using Hybrid NLP–LLM Techniques

This repository contains the reference implementation of the hybrid bug-report–driven
test input extraction pipeline proposed in the MSc thesis:

**"Bug-Report–Driven Automated Test Generation Using Hybrid NLP and Large Language Models"**

The project demonstrates how unstructured bug reports can be transformed into
high-quality, structured test inputs using a combination of:
- Regular-expression-based literal extraction
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Large Language Models (LLMs) with Tree-of-Thought prompting

These extracted inputs are then used as seed values for automated test generation tools
such as EvoSuite (Java) and Pynguin (Python).
